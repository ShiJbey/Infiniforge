# Infiniforge

InfiniForge is designed to be a NodeJS RESTful API that returns JSON
representations of procedurally generated 3D sword meshes.

## How to install and run (not using Docker)
1. ```git clone https://github.com/ShiJbey/Infiniforge```
2. ```$ cd Infiniforge```
4. ```$ npm install```
5. ```$ npm start```
6. Open your web browser and go to localhost:8080

## How to build image and run container (Docker)
1. ```$ sudo docker build -t weaponforge .```
2. ```$ sudo docker run -dti -p 8080:8080 weaponforge```
3. Open your web browser and go to <ip of Docker Containter>:8080/api

## How are models exported

When accessing the server via the rest API, geometry is exported using the
glTF 2.0 (GL Transmisssion Format ) by Khronos Group. It is a royalty-free
specification for the efficient transmission and loading of 3D scenes and
models by applications. The spec is available [here](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/ "glTF Overview").
What is returned by the API is *.glTF  output which is JSON. This
application uses the GLTF exporter provided with [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/exporters/GLTFExporter) for exporting.

## Importing Infinfiforge Models

Once the gltf (JSON) has been generated by the API, it can be saved as a
.gltf file and used in a multitude of projects. Various importers are
available from [Khronos Group](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/). As an example, this project
imports the .gltf into [Unity at runtime](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/UnityGLTF).
